SYNOPSIS

    my $object = App::BomCsv2Xls->new(inputFile => 'input.csv');

DESCRIPTION

    This module converts and sorts an outputfile from the fullBOMmount
    Eagle script into a file ready for sending into production. It will
    list all components on the board and it will filter out:

    Test points (are recognized based on their name starting with PTR1B)

    Components that have their value set to 'NC'

    Components that have their 'OPT' attribute set to "DO_NOT_MOUNT"

    The result will be an Excel file with three output sections: the
    regular components, the components that do not need to be mounted, and
    the test points.
